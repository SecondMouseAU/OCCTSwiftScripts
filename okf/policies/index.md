# Policies

* [Code structure](code-structure.md) - New code defaults to one type (or tight family) per file, organized by the repo's own existing domain vocabulary; a repo that already has blob files remediates them as a scoped, dedicated initiative rather than folding the cleanup into routine issues.
* [Code style](code-style.md) - Swift naming/API shape follows the Swift API Design Guidelines, formatting follows Google's Swift Style Guide via swift-format, and doc comments stay terse; docs/ is the single source of truth for design rationale, not a second copy of it.
* [Documentation lookup: `context` first](context-first.md) - Look docs up via context (ecosystem), context7 (external), then other repos' docs, never training-data recall.
* [Documentation updates are mandatory](docs-current.md) - Docs update with every release, or every PR for repos not yet on stable semver. See Release discipline.
* [Issue labels and project-board tracking](issue-tracking.md) - Every issue carries a type:* and priority:* label; a multi-phase initiative gets tracked on its own dedicated project board rather than folded into the repo's default backlog view.
* [Open-source boundary](open-source-boundary.md) - This repo is LGPL-2.1 and depends only on open-source Swift packages. Never propose anything that makes it depend on a closed-source project.
* [Prove the test fails](prove-the-test-fails.md) - A passing test is worth nothing until you have watched it fail. Inject the defect it exists to catch, confirm the failure, restore, and report both results.
* [Search before building](search-before-building.md) - Search this repo and its dependencies meticulously before writing new code, rather than recreating something that already exists.
* [Writing style, no em-dashes, banned words](writing-style.md) - No em-dashes anywhere; specific hedge/filler/sycophancy words and phrases (honest/honestly, "you're right") banned outright, in code, docs, commit messages, PR bodies, and third-party messages.
